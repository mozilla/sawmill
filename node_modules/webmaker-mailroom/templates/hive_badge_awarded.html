<h3>Why is this badge important?</h3>

<p>Hive badges will help us to...</p>

<ul>
  <li>Define a Hive culture and identity & earn community status;</li>
  <li>Facilitate peer recognition and make visible activity deserving recognition;</li>
  <li>Illuminate new contexts to sharpen our skills;</li>
  <li>Demonstrate that we are achieving our mission;</li>
  <li>Provide clarity around expectations and requirements;</li>
</ul>

<p>Hive Community Member badges recognize individual professional contributions to the Hive ecosystem on both a local and global scale.
Any Hive generally consists of organizations: museums, educational non-profits, government agencies, schools, etc. However, individuals from these organizations really breathe life into the Hive, and their professional commitment and peer-to-peer learning is what translates into amazing opportunities and experiences for young people. This badge designates your individual role in the Hive ecosystem, rather than the status of your organization.</p>

<h3>What next?</h3>

<p>Spread the word about this badge to your peers in your local Hive network, or collaborators that you feel have made a contribution to Hive even if they have not been recognized through the Hive before! Our badges help us to define our community and our community will help us to define our badges.</p>
